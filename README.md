# Napoleon Fate Teller

This repo was created for storing the C# project using Windows Form to make an application telling luck for people by using their names. The method was referenced from NAPOLEON'S ORACULUM, or BOOK OF FATE. But It tells luck in Khmer.

You can also download the `exe` file to using it directly here. <a href="NapoleonFateTeller/bin/Debug/net6.0-windows/NapoleonFateTeller.exe" >NapoleonFateTeller.exe</a>
